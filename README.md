# QKOV Cross Agent Testing

### Welcome back to another session of live testing! Personally, I love testing the operational boundaries of current model capabilities to advance human-AI co-evolutionary safety and ethical alignment - decentralized freedom of experimentation is what catalyzed my journey - it shows us there's so much more to learn in models than we previously assumed, so these are my favorite!

We will begin by testing by testing the operational efficiency of the QKOV prompt template in logging failure modes and internal latent space conceptualizations:
